This repository includes all my project euler code files. You can check them out but I recommend trying the problem first and if you ultimately can't solve them, then check the files out.

I have solved 23 problems and I am gradually solving more. There are only 19 files here that have been solved, the rest 4 are somewhere stored in my machine (these are the ones that were very easy and I solved them first approx 5 months ago).

There are 9 problems that are unsolved and they have a `_` in front of them. They are at a "work in progress" state so tread carefully.

All these files are Python files although I do have some C++ implementations that get the answer quicker (but take longer to write)

Best of luck and happy number crunching!
